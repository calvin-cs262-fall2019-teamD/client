## Vision Statement
Ping Pong players in Calvin want a way to keep track of their scores and wins and be able to compare their performance on a leaderboard. We plan to develop an application in Android called SnapPong to integrate the social aspects of snapchat with the competitve aspects of ping pong. This project is different to other compared application because they only have rudimentary and scattered means of keeping track of wins/scores and there is no additional social media aspect to those applications.. As there are no similar applications currently available, this app will provide useful functions such as sending game requests via Snapchat and displaying leaderboards of the users. Our primary focus will be the integration of Snapchat, which will allow users to log in using their Snapchat IDs, which creates a familiar environment for new users.

From a user perspective, we have chosen to use Android Studio integrated with snapkit API because there is a solid base of documentation and tutorials/examples which will enable us to deliver an application that looks good, operates simply, and allows users to use their snapchat account instead of creating a new login id.
